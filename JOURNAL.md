# total: 8.5 hours

# Day 1
This is the first day I start building the project, but I've been thinking, brainstorming, sketching in the margins of my books, watching YouTube videos, learning IK since the past week or two.

I knew I'd make the leg today. initially, i thought of making a simple 2 part leg with 2 joints (hip and knee), both connected directly to servos (which seems to be the most obvious approach). 

But that would mean the hip servo would have too much weight to handle (torque reduces by distance of mass, if mass is close to the servo, it's better). So, after watching more yt videos, i decided to make an effector arm connected to the leg below the knee. [refer to image]. this meant that the two servos would be put next to each other at the hip itself.

# Day 2
I figured that just this 2 axis movement would help the robot move forward and backward, but I had completely ignored the third axis! the robot wouldn't be able to turn at all :sob: 

luckily I had something in mind, like a bracket housing the 2 servos, connected to the turning servo [excellent description, ik, but refer to the image]

also, constantly trying to move the second effector servo was so tedious, having to move the servo, turning the effector arm, turning the knee segment, trying to fit it all together.

I also designed a mount for the turning servo to connect to the main body. This meant that the entire unit of leg was now connected to a body.

the body was initially just a plain circle with mounts to attach the top, but that meant too much material (and also looked kinda ugly), so I decided to cut off two edges, to make it look like a rectangle with 2 opposite curved sides.

# Day 3
The day I dreaded; the robotic arm. I watched SO many videos on how it works, and it was pretty simple, but whenever I would sketch it/try it in CAD, it just wouldn't work. I thought of trying out an effector arm like the leg, or stepper with belts, but couldn't design anything. The rotating servo part was the hardest. then (as always) I came across another arm, and for some reason it clicked this time. I felt like God and started making the arm in maybe 2-3 sittings.

I designed the arm, connected it to the main body to rotate, and ta-da, it was done.

modelling the claw was still left, but I knew how I'd do it. this was something I invented but later found out is VERY common in robotic arms :sob:

# Day 4
SUBMISSION DAY! the deadline was 12AM EDT on August 1st, but because I live in ✨ India ✨ that meant 9:30 AM. I had school, so I set 4 alarms after 4AM in 5 mins intervals, and idk if they didn't ring or it was just that I didn't wake up, but my mom woke me up at 6 (usual school time), and I panicked like anything.

I got to designing the claw, the electronics (camera, mic, sensors, RPi Zero mount, etc). my parents allowed me to skip school asw. so I designed everything, made BOM, submitted the form 5 minutes after the deadline (thankfully it wasn't closed)

aaand that's it, SuperHuman, something I'd been thinking of since such a long time, was finally designed and submitted!

### CAD, documentation: 3 hours
