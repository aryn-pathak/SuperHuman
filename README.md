# SuperHuman // Bipedal general-purpose robot+arm

The SuperHuman is a very low cost robot powered by RPi Zero and built with 3D printed parts and servos, which serves as a playground for AI to live in the real world, or any experiments with it. 

It is equipped with 2 3 axis legs and a 3 DOF robotic arm + claw for pick-and-place tasks, which also simultaneously helps in constantly balancing the robot.
